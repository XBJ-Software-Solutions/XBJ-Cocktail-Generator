### Summary of idea:

Your digital bartender will guide you to the crafting the perfect cocktail. Choose a base spirit, and your bartender will prompt you with questions to help you choose your ingredients and create a tasty drink.

### What problem or pain point does it solve?

For those that have a decent starter liquor cabinet, but don't know any cocktail recipes, this website will help you learn how to make a balanced cocktail.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.

An interactive webpage with four-ish ordered prompts that display specifically chosen ingredients (based on our proprietary algorithm). You select your chosen ingredients in order until a final result is rendered with the selected ingredients and volume properties calculated for each ingredient. We will need to have at least 12 ingredients in our "digital pantry" with requisite properties.
