        <p>
          Johnny was born in North Carolina, but he spent most of his upbringing
          in Virginia. For the past twelve years, he has been residing in
          Portland. Despite his current urban dwelling, he finds his true sense
          of belonging in nature. This is not to suggest that he doesn't
          appreciate modern conveniences, as he also enjoys watching the Trail
          Blazers on a large screen at his nearby sports bar. An interesting
          fact about Johnny is his deep affection for sweet potatoes. His
          preferred cocktail happens to be a Manhattan.

        />
        <p>
          Xin always wanted to get into acting since a kid. She has the
          opportunity to do that now, but alas, it's not quite that sustainable,
          so she is learning to code hoping to get into the tech field to make
          money. She does not have a favorite cocktail because unfortunately
          asian flush exists and she can't drink.

        />
        <p>
          Jessica is from a small town in the great Pacific Northwest. She was
          born and raised here and has also raised her own family here. She is
          married to her husband, Trevor, and has two boys Colby (20) and Carson
          (16) and two dogs. She work for a regional insurance company, in IT,
          as a Software Engineering Manager. Her favorite cocktail is a
          cosmopolitan.

        />
        <p>
          Brendan, a 25-year-old originally from Virginia, now considers Fort
          Worth his home. He proudly served in the US Army for six years, with
          postings in Colorado and Kansas. Over the last few months, he has been
          self-teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, Brendan holds
          certifications in AWS Cloud Practitioner and Professional Scrum Master
          I. His favorite cocktail is the espresso martini.
